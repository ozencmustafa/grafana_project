### Introduction

In this project, I fetch the currency data from an internet website and show these currencies on a grafana dashboard.
To do this I used Python and Linux shell scripting combination.
I used the procedure to install a grafana server on ubuntu 20.04 TLS.
To fetch the data from internet I used Beautifulsoup and to correct and analysis of the data, I used shell scripting.
I converted the fetched data into SQLite and I integrated this SQLIte db as data source for Grafana.


Grafana SQLite Datasource is well described in the below link.
